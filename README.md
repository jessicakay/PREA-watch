# PREA-watch

The PREA Watch project is a collaboration with Black & Pink Boston, looking at sexual violence in Massachusetts prisons and jails. Similar to InspectionBrowser, PREA Watch is a tool for reshaping data presented in formats that are otherwise not useful for data analysis. While the initial stages of PREA Watch are simply tools to reshape a specific dataset for inclusion in a GLM, this project will eventually be combined with InspectionBrowser.
